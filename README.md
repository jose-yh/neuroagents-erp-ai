# 🤖 neuroagents-erp-ai

Hello. Welcome to my page.

After studying Data Science and AI, I focus on a deeper understanding of how algorithms and AI agents work and how they can be applied to continuously and efficiently improve processes. 

Through these projects, I explore different ways AI can add value to decision-making, automation, optimization, and predictive analytics.

This repository compiles the projects I developed during my training, as well as others I continue to work on as part of my specialization.


## 🎯 Objective

Apply advanced AI and Data Science concepts to:

- Understand the behavior of operational processes.
- Build intelligent agents that learn from the environment.
- Contribute to improving decision-making efficiency on platforms such as ERPs, SAP, and other technologies.


## 📂 List of projects:

- In this repository a game is being created in Python (Battleship PvE), where players face an AI. https://github.com/apvwbm/Team-Challenge---Team-Leviathan
- Database Design and SQL Murder. This repository contains two practical exercises related to databases. https://github.com/apvwbm/Team-Challenge---Team-Miss-Marple/tree/main/practica_2
- This repository showcases the basic tools for machine learning. This project is part of the first phase of the Team Challenge, which aims to develop a set of basic tools to facilitate the creation of machine learning models. https://github.com/apvwbm/Team-Challenge---Lost-in-ML/tree/main
- This repository contains the development work for Team Challenge: Pipelines. We implemented Scikit-learn pipelines to predict car prices (Price) using a Kaggle dataset. https://github.com/neural-insights/Team-Challenge---Still_Lost_in_ML
- This repository contains the Bootcamp classes in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. https://github.com/jose-yh
- This repository contains the development of the "ML_Real estate price predictions" project to predict real estate prices using an API requested to Idealista. https://github.com/jose-yh/ML_Real_estate_price_predictions
- This repository builds a REST API using FastAPI to estimate a car's price based on its features. It uses a Random Forest-based machine learning model trained with real-world data. https://github.com/Jobave589/API_con_Render


## 🧠 Technologies and tools

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, Markdown
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow (basic)
- **Frameworks:** Streamlit, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Environments:** VSCode, Google Colab

## 🚀 In development

- Explore Deep Learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Learn about MLOps and cloud deployment.
- Develop interactive dashboards with integrated AI.
- Connect models with APIs from different systems (IT, ERP, among others)..
  
Also, I will continue to upload my personal projects and ideas about intelligent agents here.
