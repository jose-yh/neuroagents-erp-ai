# neuroagents-erp-ai
After studying Data Science and AI, I focus on a deeper understanding of how algorithms and AI agents work and how they can be applied to continuously and efficiently improve processes. 

Through these projects, I explore different ways AI can add value to decision-making, automation, optimization, and predictive analytics.

This repository compiles the projects I developed during my training, as well as others I continue to work on as part of my specialization.
